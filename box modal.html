                <span class="important"> Horses are hoofed mammals that have lived with humans for thousands of
                    years.</span>
                Almost all of the horses alive today are domesticated and descend from extinct wild horses. Horses have
                roamed the planet for about 50 million years
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="important">Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, possessing
                    an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response.</span> Related to this need to
                flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying
                down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called mares,
                carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run
                shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between
                the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of
                between 25 and 30 years.
